    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>DecodeX does not collect or store any personal data from users. However, to perform its core functions, DecodeX processes visual data through various third-party artificial intelligence tools.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Usage</h2>
    <p>DecodeX does not use or retain user data. The data is processed anonymously through third-party tools to deliver the required results. Once the processing is complete, the data is not stored on DecodeX’s servers or systems.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>DecodeX integrates with the following third-party tools, which may process your data anonymously:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> Used for managing subscription and monetization features. (<a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>)</li>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> Used for serving in-app advertisements. (<a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>)</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase:</strong> Used for analytics and backend services. (<a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>DecodeX is not responsible for how these third parties handle your data. We recommend reviewing their privacy policies for detailed information.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>DecodeX does not store any user data on its servers. All outputs generated from user input are stored locally on the user’s physical device. If you delete the app, you also delete all the data associated with it.</p>

    <h2>5. User Responsibility</h2>
    <p>Since DecodeX does not retain or process user data outside the context of third-party services, we do not have any obligation to secure or protect user data beyond what is outlined by these services. Users are encouraged to back up their results manually if required, as deleting the app will result in permanent data loss.</p>

    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>DecodeX does not handle or store user data, and thus, we have no security obligations regarding user data. Any security concerns should be directed to the third-party services mentioned above.</p>

    <h2>7. User Rights</h2>
    <p>As DecodeX does not retain user data, we cannot offer mechanisms for accessing, modifying, or deleting user data. All interactions with the app occur in real-time and are not stored post-processing.</p>

    <h2>8. Compliance with Data Protection Laws</h2>
    <p>DecodeX processes all data anonymously and does not retain any identifiable user information. However, certain regions may have data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) that impose additional responsibilities. Since DecodeX relies on third-party tools, their compliance policies apply. If you have concerns about compliance, we recommend contacting the third-party services directly.</p>

    <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
